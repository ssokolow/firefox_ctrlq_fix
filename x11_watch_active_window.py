"""python-xlib example which reacts to changing the active window/title.

Requires:
- Python
- python-xlib

Tested with Python 2.x because my Kubuntu 14.04 doesn't come with python-xlib
for Python 3.x.

Design:
-------

Any modern window manager that isn't horrendously broken maintains an X11
property on the root window named _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW.

Any modern application toolkit presents the window title via a property
named _NET_WM_NAME.

This listens for changes to both of them and then hides duplicate events
so it only reacts to title changes once.
